    <p>👋 Hi, my name is George Montee. I've been working with computers since I was ten years old. I grew up spending many hours pouring over dry, humorless manuals, internet forums, and a whole lot of trial and error, piecing code together. I did it originally for the challenge, but later I found that making people's lives better via software solutions was my calling in life.
 
I dedicated twenty years of my life serving our great nation, in the United States Air Force. I embraced many opportunities to travel and live all over the world, and to meet, train, mentor, and lead people from all walks of life. During my service, I was a software engineer that led agile teams analyze, design, implement, test, deploy, and maintain enterprise level web application and database solutions.

Since returning to civilian life, I've transitioned to the Cloud domain, learning AWS and Azure. I'm looking for hands-on opportunities to continue my journey, growing in knowledge of the cloud.
