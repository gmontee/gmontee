  <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is George Montee. I've been working with computers since I was ten years old. I grew up spending many hours pouring over dry, humorless manuals, internet forums, and a whole lot of trial and error, piecing code together. I did it originally for the challenge, but later I found that making people's lives better via software solutions was my calling in life.</p>

  <p>I dedicated twenty years of my life serving our great nation, in the United States Air Force. I embraced many opportunities to travel and live all over the world, and to meet, train, mentor, and lead people from all walks of life. During my service, I was a software engineer that led agile teams analyze, design, implement, test, deploy, and maintain enterprise level web application and database solutions.</p>

  <p>Since returning to civilian life, I've transitioned to the Cloud domain, learning AWS and Azure. I'm looking for hands-on opportunities to continue my journey, growing in knowledge of the cloud.</p>
